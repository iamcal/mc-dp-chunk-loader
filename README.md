# Minecraft Datapack: Chunk Loader

A variation on the Vanilla Tweaks chunk loader datapack, changing the items to something more obtainable, and loading a 3x3 chunk block at a time.

If multiple chunk loaders are placed "overlapping", chunks will not be correctly loaded when one of them gets broken (the original mod also has this issue, but is simplier to understand when it happens).
